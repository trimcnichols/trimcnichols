- :satellite:My project ideas for my HomeLab: 
    <ul>
      <li> :sunny: Create a sunlight map around my house so I can grow appropriate flowers and vegetables in the right area(sun or shade loving plant). I will use raspberry pi for sunlight sensor IoT.</li>
     
    </ul>


- :satellite: In my free time I like to do: gardening, mountain biking, cooking, learning a new technology or language.
